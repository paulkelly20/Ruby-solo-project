Heroku Deployment https://music-shop-pk.herokuapp.com/

The owner of a Record Store wants an app which will help to keep on top of the store inventory. This is not an app that customers will see, but will be used to check stock levels and see what needs to be ordered soon.

You should be able to add stock, which would have an Artist and Album as well as the quantity available.

CSS styling only to be used.

MVP:
Create albums with the quantity that are in stock
Create artists
Show an inventory page listing albums and artists
Show a stock level for the inventory items e.g. High/Medium/Low
